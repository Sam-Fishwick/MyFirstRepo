# MyFirstRepo

This is a personal respository to house my personal projects.

Currently this repository contains a python web-scraping program intended to gather price data from Amazon.co.uk via its HTML.

This project is intended to demonstrate data-gathering capabilities in python as well as eventually providing a small data-set with which to demonstrate SQL querying, and python data-cleaning, data-manipulation, and data-visualisation capabilities (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, etc.).

To Do:
- Connect to a database (e.g., MS SQLServer) and export data using SQL queries with pyodbc module.
- Make code more modular with functions (increase readibility and testability)
  - e.g., move everything out of main for-loop into separate functions and call within smaller for-loop.
- Write some unit-tests for more tailored and repeatable testing.
